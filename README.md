# Testcontainers

Testcontainers is a Ruby library that provides a convenient way to run Docker containers for your tests. It is inspired by the popular Testcontainers library for Java.

This library simplifies the process of managing Docker containers during testing, making it easier to ensure a consistent and isolated environment for each test. It supports a wide range of containers, including databases, message queues, and web servers.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add testcontainers

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install testcontainers

## Usage

To use Testcontainers in your tests, first create and start a container in your test setup. For example, to run a Redis container:

```ruby
container = Testcontainers::DockerContainer.new("redis:6.2-alpine").with_exposed_port(6379)
container.start
```



In your tests, you can now access the container's host and mapped port:

```ruby
host = container.host
port = container.mapped_port(6379)
```



This allows you to connect to the containerized service and perform your tests. After running your tests, you can stop and delete the container:


```ruby
container.stop
container.delete
```

For a more detailed example, please refer to the Quickstart Guide under the docs folder.
